陳浩天：
多謝堂主！我嚟啦！哎。
Chan Ho-tin:
Thanks Lewis! Here I come! Argh.

唔好意思啊各位，都拖咗好耐，頭先發生咩事呢？原來有人行過呢，踩{到/咗}粒掣，熄咗
嗰電掣，哦所以就係咁樣。冇乜事，不過呢個projector燒咗。咁本來呢就...
哎吔，又好返喇？有人CPR佢呢可能噤返醒佢囉。咁呢就其實仲有兩個環節嘅，咁呢就係馮
敬恩呢因爲佢離開咗香港，佢去咗旅行，啊(aa2)
做啲離地嘅嘢（台下笑）。咁呢就唔能夠嚟到做嘉賓，但係佢都好有心，錄咗段片，就十一
分鐘嘅。
Sorry everyone, holding you up for such a long time, what had happened? It
turns out that someone have just walked pass, stepped on a button, and switched
off the power button. That’s what happened. It is nothing really, but the
projector is burnt out. So originally… oh, it is working again? Someone has
given it a CPR and shocked it back to life. So, there are actually two more
sections, so, as Billy Fung has left Hong Kong on vacation, aargh, doing
something so unworldly (crowd laughs). So he cannot come in person, but he has
been very considerate and made a recording, that is eleven minutes long.

（台下：哇）
[Audible gasp from the audience :o)]

哇，大家哇一聲喎。（台下笑）哇真係好興奮，啊正啊，好長啊我想聽多啲啊係咪啊？咁大
家想唔想聽先？（台下：想！）想！啊我聽到好多人嗌想啊，係啊。咁就大家就頂埋佢啦，
啊(aa2)。咁我就，我陣間我嘅結語呢就會快少少，咁會係個尾班車完結之前呢就放大家走
。

Wow, you guys just gave me a wow. (crowd laughs) Wow, I am excited too, it is
great, it is so long and I want to hear more of it, isn’t that so? So, does
everyone want to hear it? Yes! Ah, I hear a lot of you shouting yes, yeah. So
everyone please bear with it, ah. So I will, I will be a bit quicker with my
epilogue, so we can let everyone go before the last train.

好，睇片！
Good, let’s roll!
